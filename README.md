# smophat7.github.io

This site ([https://smophat7.github.io](https://smophat7.github.io)) was used to house my personal portfolio site, but I have sinced moved that to [spencermoffat.com](https://spencermoffat.com). Now this is just a collection of older projects from when I first was teaching myself about web development before I started my BS in Computer Science. These projects very much reflect my general lack of experience, but I don't want to delete them. So, I figured I'd just leave them accessible here with the disclaimer that ***hey, it's been a few years.*** But, I was trying to figure stuff out and eager to learn.

### Actually useable/kinda useful
- [Pomodoro Productivity Timer](https://smophat7.github.io/pomodoro) (/pomodoro)
- [Memory Game](https://smophat7.github.io/memoryGame) (/memoryGame)


### Figuring out a little bit of JavaScript
- [ISBN Converter](https://smophat7.github.io/ISBNConvertor/) (/ISBNConverter)

### Just barely learning HTML and CSS. Purely visual
- [BYU Dance Redesign](https://smophat7.github.io/cfacChallenge/home.html) (/cfacChallenge - actually used this for a job application and got it... then turned it down)
- [Provo Bakery Redesign](https://smophat7.github.io/provoBakery/provoBakeryHome) (/provoBakery)
- [Platform Design Templates](https://smophat7.github.io/platformDesignTemplates/platform.html) (/platformDesignTemplates - oldest, crappiest junk there is)
