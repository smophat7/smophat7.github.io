#Pomodoro Timer - Summer 2020

With unexpected additional time in the summer of 2020, I decided to learn more about web development. I'm always seeking to be as productive as possible, so when I stumbled upon the Pomodoro Technique I figured I could just make a pomodoro timer of my own.

Much of the project structure and certain aspects of the code reveal my relative naivety at the time (there's a lot I would do differently now), but I leave this project accessible to demonstrate growth and desire to learn. In my spare time before I was even studying computer science I learned how to solve a problem using modern web technologies and did so with clarity and attention to detail. While my future use of lilbraries like Bootstrap and jQuery may be limited, I got good practice at learning how to use different tools.
